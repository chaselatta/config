A repository to store my shell configurations. Feel free to use as you see fit
but I make no guarantee that anything in here works or is even correct.

To get started on a new machine.
- Install [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com/)
- Make fish your default shell [docs](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/faq.html#faq-default)
- Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:chaselatta/config.git ~/.config`
- (Optionally) install Xcode settings by running `install-xcode-settings`
- (Optionally) add a `~/.config/fish/local.fish` file for settings specific to this machine
